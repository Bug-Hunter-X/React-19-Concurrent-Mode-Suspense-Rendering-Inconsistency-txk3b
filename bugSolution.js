The solution involves restructuring the component tree to prevent the race condition.  By moving the Suspense component higher up in the tree, the fallback content can be presented more effectively while the concurrent rendering system handles the nested components. Additional optimization can involve using techniques like lazy loading and code splitting to efficiently handle large or complex components. Another approach is to utilize React.startTransition for less critical updates, thereby preventing those updates from blocking the rendering process.  This allows the Suspense component to resolve data more predictably, resulting in a smoother and more consistent rendering experience.  Here's an example of the improved component structure:

```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <div>
        <LazyComponent />
      </div>
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```
This approach moves the Suspense component higher in the hierarchy, allowing the fallback to be displayed more appropriately while the asynchronous content loads. The use of `lazy` ensures efficient loading of potentially large or complex components.
