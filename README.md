# React 19 Concurrent Mode Suspense Rendering Inconsistency
This repository demonstrates a bug in React 19's concurrent rendering mode when using Suspense in deeply nested components.  The bug leads to rendering inconsistencies, where components fail to update or data displays incorrectly.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution.

## Bug Description
Deeply nesting a Suspense component within a component tree that utilizes concurrent rendering can create a race condition. This race condition can lead to components not updating correctly, or data being displayed incorrectly due to the timing of Suspense's fallback rendering and the concurrent rendering process. 

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the component tree and optimizing the use of Suspense to avoid the race condition.  Specifically, moving Suspense higher up in the component tree and ensuring data fetching is handled efficiently to minimize the time it takes for Suspense to resolve the data.
